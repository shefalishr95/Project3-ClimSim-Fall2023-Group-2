### A Note on Contributions

Project 3

Team members: Clarence Jiang, Shefali Shrivastava, Arnulfo Trevino, Chencan Zou
,Mansi Singh, Yucheng Lu

Summary: In this project, we mainly explored how to help ClimSim machine learning researchers improve the usage of their product through interacting with their quick_start_demo notebook. We mainly focused on the cloud notebook and advance ML model directions, with some testing on Google Colab and Hugging face and ML models like random forest and transformer model.

[Contribution Statement]: Arnulfo worked on reproducing the notebook with upgrade to Google Colab Pro. Shefali and Chencan together worked on testing data loading on hugging face. Shefali also did the presentation and revised the slides. Clarence worked on testing the random forest model, while Yucheng worked on a tranformer model. Both machine learning achieve some visual results. We together came up with some ideas about what directions can be explored.
